In this thesis, we explored four different programming tools from software engineering for the development of intelligent systems, broadly addressing cognitive complexity arising in four phases of Royce's Waterfall method~\autoref{fig:waterfall_model}. These tools have varying degrees of practicality, from highly theoretical (e.g. adversarial testing of differentiable programs ~\autoref{ch:difftest}) to more pragmatic (e.g. containerization ~\autoref{ch:ducker}). In each chapter, we provide some motivating examples and use cases which demonstrate key deficiencies in state-of-the-art programming tools for intelligent systems and propose candidate solutions which address a few of those shortcomings. While we hope that intelligent system programmers (e.g. roboticists and machine learning practitioners) may derive some value from the tools themselves, our intention is to be \textit{illustrative} rather than \textit{prescriptive}.

In building tools and validating their effectiveness on toy applications, it is our hope that middleware and tool developers will carefully consider how software tools can reduce cognitive complexity. Tools can augment the cognitive capacity of humans to reason about facts in the presence of uncertainty~\citep{famelis2012partial}, and provide ergonomic debugging and visualization assistance (e.g. \autoref{ch:hatchery}). We also hope to convey the importance of notation. Good notation forces authors to think carefully about their abstractions, makes logical errors conspicuous, and allows the reader to more easily understand the implications of their own abstractions. We hope that the programming tools illustrated in this thesis will inspire developers to re-imagine the potential for computer-aided programming in the design of intelligent systems.

By complementing the cognitive abilities of human programmers -- who excel at creative problem solving and high-level abstract reasoning -- with the raw symbolic processing abilities of programming tools, we can accelerate the design~\autoref{ch:hatchery}, development~\autoref{ch:kotlingrad}, validation~\autoref{ch:difftest} and deployment~\autoref{ch:ducker} of intelligent systems in real-world applications. This process is a virtous cycle which deserves domain-specific tools and practices due to the opportunities which intelligent systems afford and the unique interplay between human and machine intelligence.

As we begin to develop autonomous systems which play increasingly active roles in society, software engineers and machine learning practitioners must play an active role in shaping the behavior and dynamics of those systems. Language designers would do well to consider the role of human and machine intelligence and the value of tools in facilitating that relationship. This requires domain-specific models to express human knowledge i.e. differentiable programs and expert type systems to reason about compositionality and correctness (\autoref{ch:kotlingrad}). Ensuring software artifacts are safe and reproducible will also require build systems and best practices in developer operations (e.g. \autoref{ch:ducker}).

Traditional software engineering prescribes a rigorous process model and testing methodology~\autoref{fig:waterfall_model} which has guided generations of software projects. To become a true engineering discipline, the machine learning community will need to adopt a more rigorous methodology for building autonomous systems. Machine learning models are trained on \textit{objective functions}, which are typically one- or low-dimensional functions for measuring the overall performance of a system, typically outputting a scalar value known as an \textit{error} or \textit{loss}. In practice, we care about a multiobjective set of criteria~\citep{censi2015mathematical}, including energy efficiency~\citep{paull2010novel}, memory~\citep{memory2013mitliagkas}, re/usability~\citep{breuleux2017automatic,deleu2019torchmeta}, predictability~\citep{turner2017well}, latency~\citep{ravanelli2018twin}, robustness~\citep{pineau2003policy}, explainability~\citep{turner2016model}, traceability~\citep{guo2017semantically, tsirigotis2018orion}, un/certainty~\citep{diaz2018interactive}, simplicity~\citep{kastner2019representation}, trustworthiness~\citep{xu2017efficient}, transferability~\citep{mehta2019active}, scalability~\citep{luan2019break} and many other factors.

Much of the work involved in machine learning is designing representations which are suitable for downstream tasks and loss functions which accurately measure performance on those tasks. So long as we can measure these parameters, modern function approximators can optimize for any single criterion or combination thereof (\autoref{eq:moo_spec}). When designing a self-driving vehicle, we must optimize for passenger safety, however doing so na\"ively will train a vehicle that never moves, or always yields to passing vehicles. Building representations and loss functions which capture the full range of objectives can be a painstaking process.

In traditional software engineering, it is reasonable to assume those implementing a new system have some implicit domain knowledge and are well-intentioned human beings working towards a common goal -- given a coarse description, they can fill in the blanks. When building an intelligent system, we would be safer to assume the requirements are implemented by a na\"ive but obedient genie. Given some data and an optimization metric, it will take every available shortcut to grant our wishes. If we are not careful about correctly specifying the requirements, this entity will create a solution that simply does not work (in the best case), or appears to work but is truly cursed~\citep{bellman1957dynamic}.

When building an intelligent system developers must carefully ask, ``What is the expected behavior of the system we are designing?'' This question is often very troublesome, for the requirements cannot be loose specifications, but precise constraints on the solution set. Fully specifying the requirements is indistinguishable from implementing the system -- with the right language abstractions (e.g.\ declarative programming), requirements and implementation can even take the same notation (e.g. SQL, Prolog). But how can we be assured the resulting system satisfies our requirements? Most humans are capable of safely driving a vehicle, but even the best engineers struggle to write a driving algorithm. Labeling the data by hand is too expensive. Exhaustive verification is right out the window.

Type systems, compilers and fuzzers are all part of a broader class of validation and verification tools. The goal of these tools is to trade cognitive complexity for computational complexity. Some errors (e.g. syntactical errors), are minor nuisances and can be detected with a good incremental parser (\autoref{subsec:the-parser}). Others, as shown in~\autoref{fig:verification_complexity}, have higher cognitive complexity but can be detected by spending computation. We argue this computational cost is often justified as computation is cheap and undetected bugs can have catastrophic consequences. Studies show the earlier bugs are detected, the more likely they are to be fixed~\citep{distefano2019scaling} -- saving minutes in development could save lives during operation. Spending computation frees up valuable cognitive resources for other tasks.

Fuzz testing remains an economically and computationally efficient alternative to formal verification. As we show in \autoref{sec:prob_ad_test}, by making practical assumptions about the model and oracle, we can spend a fixed computational budget to detect more severe errors with lower fiscal and computational overhead.

Learning capabilities will play a crucial role in autonomous systems. As today's engineers begin to incorporate learning in tomorrow's safety-critical robotic systems, we believe the increased assurance provided by intelligent validation and verification tools will be indispensable for the widespread deployment of these complex adaptive cyberphysical systems.

Second, in \autoref{ch:kotlingrad}, we introduce a new DSL for the Kotlin language, which allows users to write differentiable programs. Third, in \autoref{ch:difftest}, we introduce a testing methodology which improves data efficiency in a toy regression problem. Finally, in \autoref{ch:ducker}, we present DuckieOS, a containerized tool for the Duckietown platform, which improves the reproducibility of software installation on a mobile embedded computer.
