        Thank you for your highly constructive feedback on my Master's thesis, originally submitted for review on the 31st of August, 2019.

        In response to your written comments dated the 5th of November, 2019 and after close consultation with my advisors, I am pleased to enclose a new manuscript, with revisions encompassing the following chapters:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Expanded experimental validation (Chapter 4)
            \item Updated conclusion and future research (Chapter 6)
            \item Additional context and discussion of prior work (Chapters 1-5)
            \item Formal grammar and matrix notation (Appendix A)
        \end{itemize}

        I wish to thank my advisors, Dr. Paull and Dr. Famelis, whose guidance and encouragement have been integral to the construction of this thesis.
