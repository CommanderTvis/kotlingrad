        \opening{Dear President Feeley and esteemed members of the Jury,}
        Thank you for your highly constructive feedback on my Master's thesis, originally submitted for review on the 31st of August, 2019.

        In response to your written comments dated the 5th of November, 2019 and after close consultation with my advisors, I am pleased to enclose a new manuscript, with the following revisions:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Expanded experimental validation (Chapter 4)
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Clearly separate our contribution (\S 4.2) from prior work (\S 4.1)
                    \item Comparison of adversarial efficiency with random baseline
                    \item Formalized problem statement and proposed approach
                    \item Visual aides demonstrating adversarial attack
                    \item Validate code samples to ensure compilation
                \end{itemize}
            \item Minor DSL updates (Chapter 3)
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Clarify where our DSL falls on the Chomsky hierarchy (\S 3.6)
                    \item Kotlin$\nabla$ implements \textit{symbolic differentiation} (\S 3.17)
                    \item Add support for heterogenously ranked expressions (Tab. 3.2)
                    \item Improve notation for type-level arithmetic (\S 3.8)
                \end{itemize}
            \item Additional context and discussion of prior work (Chapters 1-5)
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item De-emphasize the connection to robotics development
                    \item Fix clerical and grammatical mistakes
                    \item Add missing citations to relevant literature
                    \item Update code samples to fix syntactical errors
                    \item Added internal links and references
                \end{itemize}
            \item Updated formal grammar and matrix notation (Appendix A)
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Include Backus-Naur form grammar (\S A.1)
                    \item Describe polynomial regression (\S A.3)
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

        I wish to thank my advisors, Dr. Paull and Dr. Famelis, whose guidance and encouragement have been integral to the construction of this thesis.

        Thank you once again for your time and consideration.
